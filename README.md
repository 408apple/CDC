[ Facts and Idea]

Create Better Window Without using Powershell Scripts!

It Can Save The Compile Output to EXE, DLL, or MEMORY!

It Can Add Icon for Exe, and Window Icon at Onces!

It Can Do More Than Powershell Script

It save time and much easyier to code in CS than PS Script

I Just Add CodeDom compiler in PS Script, to compile
CSharp From  Url..

It aslo can do other Languages Beside CSharp like VisualBasic and Javacript
with CodeDom Compiler can also adjust different version of language!
